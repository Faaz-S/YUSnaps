# Routes

<Routes> is a component provided by React Router that is used to define the routes for your application. It's part of the declarative routing system in React Router.

Route Components:
Inside <Routes>, you can use the <Route> component to define individual routes. Each <Route> component specifies a path and the component that should be rendered when the path matches the current URL.

# Here are some key characteristics and uses of SVG files:

Scalability: SVG images can be scaled to any size without losing quality. This is particularly useful for logos, icons, and other graphics that need to be displayed at different resolutions.

Vector Graphics: SVG is based on vector graphics, which use mathematical equations to define shapes and paths. This makes SVG files smaller in size compared to raster images, and they can be edited and manipulated more easily.

Text-Based: SVG files are plain text files, often written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language). This makes them human-readable and allows developers to create or modify them using a simple text editor.
